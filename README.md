 - rewritten Git in a brand new name: Gut.

 - if you happened to read this repo via Github, it means this project goal was half suceeded: Gut has been equipped with least minimum Git-like functionalities: init, ~~add, commit. and push~~.

 - i am amazed how handy the Git functionality is, able to track to billions of code changes, with just a short cute command: "Git".

 - trying to understand Git under the hood, by rewrite things basic from the start, but not necessarily need to reinvent the wheel.

 - reading source code of Git bring me the fact that Git created by Linus Torvalds. used to want to understand what Linus Torvalds means by 'beautiful code' or 'tasteful writing', so i manage myself reading his early Git source code which turned out written in C.

 - i can't understand C language yet, but i want to rewrite Git source code anyway. so i think Python is going to be an awesome icebreaker.

 - it was a great amount of luck when i found a blog named https://wyag.thb.lt, how to write reverse-engineered Git in Python.

 - simply saying: Gut was literally a copycated version of Wyag. it was like i read a recipe on how to cook a soup, and i just follow the tutorial and explanation thoroughly, cooking and serving it in a plate named Git. 

 - wish the Gut project can be used directly in the Gut code version contolling processes, the journey of recreation of the Gut itself.

 - wish Gut compatible with real Git, the Gut code source were tracked using Gut itself, but still shareable directly to Github with least need for using the real Git interaction. except for git push i think.

 - sometimes we need to let our hand dirty to give ourself chance to appreciate the Git, a beautiful-yet-complexity-but-handy thing that been taken for granted by us.
